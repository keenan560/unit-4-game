# unit-4-game

As part of a class assignment I created a RPG game with a Retro WWE (fka WWF) Wrestlemania theme. The user can select from the following superstars:

- Hulk Hogan
- Brett the Hitman Hart
- Stone Cold Steve Austin
- The Rock aka Rockymavia
- Shawn the Heartbreak Kid Michaels
- Rick the Nature Boy Flair
- Razor Ramon
- The Undertaker

Each character is an object that contains elements such as:

- health points
- attack power
- counter attack
- portrait
- theme song (mp3)

Once the user selects a character that wrestler will append his way down to the ring. The user will now have a choice to select their first opponent to battle for the ring. After the opponent is chosen and appended to the arena, the user will now take their chances in a tournament style battle to fight to survive! 

In order to win the entire game the user's character must defeat the his opponent by using the "Battle" button. This button will update each player's health points and display the attack damage administered by the user and the damage taken from the cpu's counter attack.

If the user's health points fall to or below 0 it's game over and will have to restart their journey to the top. However if the cpu's health points fall to or below 0 then that opponent is thrusted out of the arena and the user chooses their next opponent. If all of the remaining opponents is 0 then the user wins and is crown WWF Wrestlemania Champion!

Attack Power - Each wrestler's attack power is randmon number generated on each window load, therefore you never know how strong or weak your attack is. In contrast each wrestler's health points and counter attack have been manually entered. 

Below is demo to the game.


Here is a link to play enjoy!
